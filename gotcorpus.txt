The dead don't need lovers only the living

I know but I still love her

I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake

You prevented that order from being carried out 

You showed mercy to Mance Rayder 

The King's word is law 

Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to law breakers 

Show too much kindness people won't fear you 

They don't fear you they don't follow you

With respect your grace the free folk will never follow you 

No matter what you do

You're the man who burned their King alive 

First lesson stick them with the pointy end

I know which end to use 

Ygritte you know I didn't have a choice 

You always knew who I was what I am 

I have to go home now 

I know you won't hurt me 

You know nothing Jon Snow

I do know some things

I know I love you

I know you love me 

I have to go home now

I’m not asking you to forget your dead 

I’ll never forget mine 

I lost fifty brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall 

But I’m asking you to think about your children now 

They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together 

The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it

No clan can stop them 

The Free Folk can’t stop them the Night’s Watch can’t stop them and all the southern kings can’t stop them 

And even then it may not be enough but at least we give the fuckers a fight

Some men want whores on the eve of battle and some want gods

There are five pups One for each of the Stark childrenThe direwolf is the sigil of your house They were meant to have them

Don't ever betray me

I won't

Have you ever been beyond the Wall sir 

I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing boy 

And now you're here

Must not have been very good at your job

You don't have the discipline 

You don't have the training 

Your army is no army 

You don't know how to fight together

You don't know that

I know it

If you attack the Wall you'll die All of you 

All of us 

You're mine as I'm yours 

If we die we die 

But first we'll live 

Yes first we'll live

Everyone knew what this place wasand no one told me 

No one but you 

My father knew and left me to rot at the Wall all the same

Sometimes there is no happy choice Sam only one less grievous than the others

They were born on the wrong side of the Wall doesn't make them monsters

I swore a vow to the Night's Watch 

If I don't take my own word seriously what sort of "Lord of Winterfell" would I be

It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head

The King is a lost cause it's the rest of us I'm worried about

We've had vicious kingsand we've had idiot kings but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!

Far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons

Perhaps you should speak to me more softly then 

Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies

I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime 

I'm guilty of being a dwarf

Well my brother has his swordand I have my mind

And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone

That's why I read so much Jon Snow

Let me give you some advice bastard 

Never forget what you are

The rest of the world will not 

Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you

Let them see that their words can cut you and you’ll never be free of the mockery 

If they want to give you a name takes it make it your own 

Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore

I don't believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the Wall 

I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when that Wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it

Don't fight for a king 

Don't fight for his kingdoms 

Don't fight for honor don't fight for glory don't fight for riches because you won't get any 

This is your city Stannis means to sack That's your gate he's ramming 

If he gets in it will be your house that burns 

Your gold he steals your women he rapes 

Those are brave men knocking at our door 

Let's go kill them!

When you tear out a man's tongue you are not proving him a liar you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say

Every time we deal with an enemy we create two more

The powerful have always preyed on the powerless that's how they became powerful in the first place

Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing

I think armies give you power

That’s what I do I drink and I know things

It’s not easy being drunk all the time

Everyone would do it if it were easy

Everything’s better with some wine in the belly

Not this time We’ll be staying at the finest castles and inns 

No one turns away a Lannister

I remember reading an old sailor’s proverb Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off

If you’re going to be a cripple it’s better to be a rich cripple

You love your children 

It’s your one redeeming quality 

That and your cheekbones

If I'm going to rule in Westeros I'll need to make alliances 

The best way to make alliances is with marriage

Who are you marrying this time

I don't know 

Maybe no one

But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table

Are you a queen or fish bait

I can't bring a lover to Westeros 

A king wouldn't think twice about it

I'm not proud 

I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room 

I don't want a crown 

I want you 

I love you 

And I make you happy 

You know I do 

Bring me with you 

Let me fight for you 

The dwarf told you to do this

Clever fellow 

Can't argue with his logic

I'm no use to you over there

You have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons 

Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything it's all yours for the taking 

Are you afraid 

It's your counsel I need

It's yours 

Now and always

Will you fight for me 

Swear to me

The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis 

My sword is yours 

My life is yours 

My heart is yours

Ser Barristan 

When it come to battle kill that one first

King Joffrey Baratheon is dead 

Murdered at his own wedding

Who told you to take the navy 

I heard you liked ships

How many ships

How do I know you are who you say you are 

So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family 

A dragon is not a slave

Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king 

There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet 

The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing He also wants to give you his big cock

And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands 

I never demand but I'm up for anything really 

I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki 

I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me 

The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands

The common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends 

They don't care what games the high lords play 

What do you pray for Ser Jorah

I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of Old Valyeria 

I am the dragon's daughter and I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming 

I will 

But it is not your screams I want Only your life 

The time to strike is now the Starks fight the Lannisters the Baratheons fight each other 

Jorah the Andal 

I heard what you did 

Choose any horse you wish it is yours 

I make this gift to you 

I am the blood of the dragon

The dragons are all dead khaleesi

What is your name

The city is yours 

All these people are your subjects now 

Sometimes it is best to answer injustice with mercy

Would you shut up

I can't sleep until I say the names

The names of every fucking person in Westeros

Only the ones I'm going to kill

Face tits balls I hit 'em right where I wanted to

I wasn't playing 

And I don't want to be a lady

All of you better run or my brother will kill you he's a Stark 

He's more wolf than man and so am I

My father is Hand of the King 

I am not a boy I am Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me my father will have both of your heads on spikes 

Now are you going to let me by or do I have to smack you on the ear to help you with your hearing

Someday I'm going to put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull

A bruise Is a lesson and each lesson makes us better

Valar Morghulis

Nothing’s worth anything to dead men

Take that back to the kitchen 

Eat what you want

You're too smart for your own good 

Has anyone told you that

You know you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you are

You're a liar 

Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone

You promised you'd help me

Help was not promised lovely girl 

Only death 

There must be others 

Give a name any name 

A girl lacks honor

I'm not joking 

A man can go kill himself

A girl gives a man his own name 

Gods are not mocked

This is no joking thing 

Thank you

If you help me and my friends escape

This would require more than one life 

This is not part of our bargain 

Please don't eat the help

The past is already writtenThe ink is dry

I fought

I lost

Now I rest

But you Lord Snow you'll be fighting their battles forever

None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki But I am

Hold the door

I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met  

The things we do for love

A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home

My reign has just begun

Thousands of men don't need to die Only one of us

Forget the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you

This is your god now

Winter is here

Promise me Ned

My sword is yours in victory and defeat from this day until my last day

What is dead may never die

It's better to be cruel than weak

It means you're not stupid

You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore 

And now you curse me because I've come home

The giant Hodor 

Oh that's all right then 

You let a halfwit escape with a cripple 

And Rickon too the little one

I will kill that man 

I don't care how many arrows they feather me with how many spears they run through me

I'm a Greyjoy I can't fight for Robb and my father both

Hodor Hodor

I may be an imp but I never go limp

Everyone wants to know their future until they know their future

Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power 

But earning it for yourself that takes work

Perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way

The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted

Someone who’s forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide

Nothing’s worth anything to dead men

The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn’t by peeling a man’s skin off 

The best way is marriage

There’s no justice in the world

Not unless we make it

Nothing’s more hateful than failing to protect the one you love

The faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world 

One collapses so does the other

Every ambitious move is a gamble

Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously

Wars teach people to obey the sword not the gods

There’s only one war 

Life against death

Corpses raise questions 

Questions raise armies

You will find little joy in your command but with luck you will find the strength to do what needs to be done 

Kill the boy Jon Snow

Winter is almost upon us 

An apology doesn’t mean anything if you’re not looking the person in the eye

It takes courage to admit fear

It’s better to wait for the right time than risk everything

All rulers are either butchers or meat

A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion

Belief is so often the death of reason

I’m not going to stop the wheel 

I’m going to break the wheel

If I’m going to die let it happen while there is still some of me left

We don’t choose whom we love

Information is the key 

You need to learn your enemy’s strengths and strategies 

You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends

If you lose your father dies your sisters die we die

You better give me that sword!

I'm good at killing fat boys 

I like killing fat boys

I always thought you were a stunted fool 

Perhaps I was wrong

There's your peace 

Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head

There are no men like me 

Only me

You look lovely tonight Lady Stark

I'll tell you what 

I'm going to give you a present 

As soon as you've had your blood I'll put a son in you 

Mother says that shouldn't be long

If we do it your way kingslayer you'd win 

We're not doing it your way

As impossible as it seems there was once a time I was unaccustomed to wine

I happen to be a great judge of character

This sounds like a boring game

I have never been nothing 

I am the blood of the dragon

Then Lord Stark is one man in 10000 

Most are not so strong

Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him 

Twenty thousand northerners marching south to find out if he really does sh*t gold

You disappoint me child 

We've told you of your father's treason

The king has no true born sons 

Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards

Stannis is a commander 

He's lead many to war twice 

He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet

I just I always wanted to be a ranger

I always wanted to be a wizard

Targareyans wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep the bloodline pure 

Jaime and I are more than brother and sister 

We shared a womb 

It's the family name that lives on

Fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep

Fear is for the Long Night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness

A trader from Quarth told me that Dragons come from the moon

He was no dragon 

Fire cannot kill a dragon

I am a Lannister 

Tyrion son of Tywin 

Of course you have also heard the phrase a Lannister always pays his debts

I never loved my brothers 

Sad thing for a king to admit but true 

You were the brother I chose

I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out 

You seemed so good together

Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell

The Night's Watch protects the realm from

I hope so 

If he forgets be a good dog and remind him

I'm not a cripple

Then I'm not a dwarf 

My father will be rejoiced to hear it

I was also trained to kill my enemies your Grace

A dying mind is a demented mind Lord Stark

Surrounded by Lannisters 

Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces 

Winter may be coming but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother

How many kings asses have polished it I wonder

All the best swords have names you know

There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch 

The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years and you are a Stark 

I'm going to miss you

Give my regards to the Night's Watch 

I'm sure it will be thrilling 

The whores would go begging from Casterly Rock 

I just want to stand on the edge and piss off the end of the world

I have no interest in hospitality or comfort 

I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I get my crown

All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes

Lord Eddard Stark I would name you the Hand of the king

I'm not trying to honor you I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat drink and whore my way to an early grave

If he's coming this far north there's only one thing he's after

The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword

He won't be a boy forever 

And winter is coming

I'm a monster as well as a dwarf 

You should charge me double

My father is dead

And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless

The gods have no mercy that's why they're gods

I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting 

I've always hated the bells 

They ring for horror a dead king a city under siege

Tears aren't a woman's only weapon 

The best one's between your legs

I much like my head 

I don't want to see it removed just yet

Joffrey will 

The worst ones always live

I chopped wood once 

No actually I watched my brother chop wood

I'm the captain 

If this ship goes down I go down with it

You can't fuck your way out of everything

The Lord of Light wants his enemies burnt 

The Drowned God wants his enemies drowned

They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them

There's a king in ever corner now

An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend

Any man who must say I am the king is no true king

The gods love to reward a fool

Drinking and lust  no man can match me in these things 

I am the god of tits and wine

You won't be a prisoner after today you'll be my wife

I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night

A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl

Forgive my manners I don't see many ladies these days 

I don't choose Tywin Lannister 

I don't love Tywin Lannister 

I love my brother 

I love my lover

Stand down 

I said my people have bled enough and I meant it

I made a promise to defend the wall and I have to keep it 

Nothing isn't better or worse than anything Nothing is just nothing

I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself 

Won't that make for a great song

You're the golden son 

You can kill a king lose a hand fuck your own sister you'll always be the golden son

Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief that a thousand lying whores

He doesn't just talk about paying people back he does it

I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains

A man with no motive is a man no one suspects 

Always keep your foes confused

I will not become a page in someone else's history book

Please Jaime you have to He was our son our baby boy

Money buys a man's silence for a time 

A bolt in the heart buys it forever

War is war but killing a man at a wedding horrid 

What sort of monster would do such a thing 

As if men need more reasons to fear marriage

Forgive me if I don't weep for you

No one weeps for spiders or whores

Lots of people name their swords

You fight with murdering little boys but thieving is beneath you

She wanted to have me executed but I admired her

A one handed man with no family needs all the help he can get

That is the only time a man can be brave

Fear cuts deeper than swords.

Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word

Winter is coming

When you play a game of thrones you win or you die

The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword

If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words 

And if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die

Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it

The things we love destroy us every time lad 

Remember that

Death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

What is honor compared to a woman's love

What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms 

the memory of a brother's smile

Wind and words

We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love

That is our great glory, and our great tragedy

Why is it that when one man builds a wall the next man immediately needs to know what's on the other side

When the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives

And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things

If I look back I am lost

Once you’ve accepted your flaws no one can use them against you

Nothing burns like the cold

Laughter is poison to fear

Every flight begins with a fall

What do we say to the Lord of Death

Not today

Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle

Life is not a song sweetling

Someday you may learn that to your sorrow

Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones and I'll sleep more easily by night

Summer will end soon enough and childhood as well

I don't even know who my mother was

You are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister

Some woman no doubt

When he opened the door the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king

They never are

Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence

Power resides where men believe it resides

No more and no less

There’s no shame in fear my father told me what matters is how we face it

Love is poison 

A sweet poison yes but it will kill you all the same

What good is this I ask you 

He who hurries through life hurries to his grave

Old stories are like old friends she used to say. 

You have to visit them from time to time.

The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them

Everyone wants something Alayne 

And when you know what a man wants you know who he is and how to move him

If they are never certain who you are or what you want they cannot know what you are like to do next

Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose or even seem to work against you

One voice may speak you false but in many there is always truth to be found

History is a wheel for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging

Knowledge is a weapon Jon

Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle

I prefer my history dead

Dead history is writ in ink the living sort in blood

In the game of thrones even the humblest pieces can have wills of their own
 
Sometimes they refuse to make the moves you’ve planned for them 

Mark that well Alayne

It’s a lesson that Cersei Lannister still has yet to learn

Every man should lose a battle in his youth so he does not lose a war when he is old

A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies

The man who never reads lives only one

The fisherman drowned but his daughter got Stark to the Sisters before the boat went down 

They say he left her with a bag of silver and a bastard in her belly 

Jon Snow she named him after Arryn

You could make a poultice out of mud to cool a fever 

You could plant seeds in mud and grow a crop to feed your children 

Mud would nourish you where fire would only consume you but fools and children and young girls would choose fire every time

Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come

The dwarf the evil counsellor the twisted little monkey demon 

I'm all that stands between them and chaos

Storm's End has fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and gods alone know what dark powers and the good folk don't have Jamie to protect them nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor their precious Knight of Flowers

Only me the one they hate

I am not threatening the king ser 

I'm educating my nephew

Bornn next time ser Meryn speaks kill him

That was a threat 

See the difference

Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding Lord Manderly But you refused the call

You Swore allegiance to House Stark Lord Glover But in their hour of greatest need you refused the call

And you Lord Cerwyn your family was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton but still you refused the call

House Mormont remembers 

The North remembers

We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark 

I dont care if he's a bastard

Ned Stark’s blood runs in his veins 

He is my king to this day until his last day 

Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly 

My son died fighting for Robb Stark the Young Wolf 

I didn't think we would find another king in my lifetime 

I didn't commit my men to your cause because i didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing 

But i was wrong 

Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding He is the White Wolf The King in the North

I did not fight beside you on the field 

I will regret that until my dying day 

A man can only admit to when he was wrong and ask forgiveness

There is nothing to forgive my lord

There will be more fights to come. 

House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years 

And I will stand behind Jon Snow THE KING IN THE NORTH

THE KING IN THE NORTH THE KING IN THE THE KING IN THE NORTH

A very small man can cast a very large shadow

The great thing about reading is that it broadens your life

People often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when it’s served up

Chaos isn’t a pit 

Chaos is a ladder

I want to fight for the side that fights for the living

In battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten

Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again 

The fall breaks them

And some are given a chance to climb they cling to the realm or the gods or love

Only the ladder is real 

The climb is all there is

There is only one god and his name is Death

I demand a trial by combat

knowledge isn't power 

Power is Power

Though I would treasure your friendship I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder 

And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out remember this whatever their price I'll beat it

I like living

And now I've struck a king Did my hand fall from my wrist

Winter is here

The Night is dark and full of terrors

valar dohaeris

well father always promised didn’t he

I wish I was the monster you all think I am

Everyone who is not us is an enemy

A Lion does not concern himself with the opinion of the sheep

They don't hurt little girls in dorne

Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls

You're a clever man

But you're not half as clever as you are

still makes me more clever than you

i swear to you sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one

poison is a woman's weapon men prefer steel
